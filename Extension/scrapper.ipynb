            "I'll be honest with you, at first I was a bit skeptical. I was told to avoid \"Renewed\" phones because unlike Apple-refurbished phones, different refurbishment factories are sourced online, and the fact there are only stock images rather than actual pictures of the phone someone took. My first concern was from the other reviews I've read that range from 70% battery capacity, to detecting random touch screen inputs, to speakers not working, to vibration modules not working at all, which seemed like buying refurb phones from the Internet is a pretty big gamble. Fortunately, and thankfully, I have found a diamond in the rough. This was a refurb I bought from Stone Digital. This 11 didn't bug me about \"non-genuine Apple parts\" messages, didn't have touch screen problems (at least I put the screen protector on before turning it on for the first time if that helps), Speakers (both external and head speaker) worked fine, SIM card reader worked fine, Battery Capacity was surprisingly at 100%, and Face ID and True Tone ACTUALLY worked! The one and ONLY problem I have, is that there is a small 3-in-a-row group of dead pixels near the bottom of the screen, but is just barely noticeable unless you've been looking at something with Dark Mode on for a while and look closely.Before this 11, I was just using a 6S Plus that I've kept for seven years, and it was long overdue to get at least a better phone. I know its not the latest and greatest iPhone model (given that the 11 is a 4 year-old phone), I was looking at cheap/affordable upgrade options that I would feel comfortable with. I think it was a decent purchase getting this.\n",
