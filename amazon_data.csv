I have become an avid Pelican brand consumer.  I only used to buy the Otter Box cases for my devices, until my first Pelican trial a few years ago.  Since then, I have only purchased Pelican.  Like many others here, I bought my new Pelican case for the iPhone 15 Pro Max before even receiving the phone.  Unfortunately, this case falls short of the quality I've become accustomed to.The phone case itself is excellent!  It looks and feels strong and doesn't feel too bulky.  My only real issue is with the belt clip; it is too flexible.  It is a pain in the backside getting the phone out of the clip because the clip seems to not want to give it up!  On the flip side, getting my phone back into the case is another comic show.  The single ""arm"" or ""clip"" keeps pushing the soft rubber off the phone case and just becomes outright annoying.I think Pelican just pushed this one out of the factory a bit too hastily.  As so many others have expressed, this case and clip fall short of what I have become used to previously.  Not abandoning the brand, but may have to abandon this case and clip....

By far the only case I will use. Since ‚Äò76 this is the only brand that is ACTUALLY used by the military and other industries such as emergency services. Others claim ‚Äúmilitary grade‚Äù but have no ACTUAL experience in this Field. Otter Box is bloatware and not appealing. Yes you can get a decent case for cheap as the phone accessory market is saturated, but when you‚Äôre shelling out $1K for a handheld computer, er on the safe side. Sleek, protective and not bulky. I was concerned for the screen speaker on iPhone 15 pro max as I did not notice it, but Pelican has you covered. 10 thumbs up, I even drop it on concrete to show people.

¬†As of 22 Sep 2023, this Pelican case was purchased ahead of taking delivery of iPhone 15 pro max. This phone and case replaced my otterbox clear case for the 13 pro max. Pelican is the world leader in protective cases for all types of equipment, so i will give them the benefit of the doubt even though they recently started making phone cases. For sure this is a bit bulkier than the otterbox, but only slightly and this Pelican case is more rugged. Precisely what i needed for this very expensive phone that is my daily driver. The case is more clear on the back than the sides (with rubbery feel for added grip). It is a double layer case with a thin layer that fits around the sides of the phone, which then slips into the full body protective case. This is what adds the extra bulk, but also the added layer of protection. I do not use the belt clip as i prefer to have the phone in my pocket. But the belt clip can add another layer of protection.The Action Button: Pelican got this wrong, unfortunately! The action button with this case is useless. The flap on the left side of the case used to cover the action button makes the button inaccessible and almost always requires two hand to operate. Pelican needs to revise this case. Or, better yet issue a recall. Of not provide a fix for all those who purchased this case free of charge if requested. I will be reaching out to Pelican on this flaw/mistake.Overall, i like the case and use a pop-socket on the back. the magnets in the case provide a super strong üí™ hold for the wireless charger that will support this.

¬†I've owned Pelican Cases for other items in the past and they are amongst the best but this is my first time purchasing a Pelican Phone Case. I know they changed the design from last years iPhone 14 pro case but I can't comment on that one. This one seems to be very similar to the Otterbox Defender in the way the case goes together. Its looks and feels great but they need to make the outer rubber shell stiffer and thicker around the buttons and charge port. Especially near the charge port cover its paper thin and peels off with very light pressure. I put phones in my pocket and I know this is going to be an issue snagging when I pull it out. Honestly I'm on the fence about having to return it, I have it on my phone now and like it enough to give it try for a week or two but for the $70 I paid I'm not necessarily satisfied. There's also a flap cover over the new action button that should be a button. I'm not knocking the brand but hopefully Pelican is listening because this case could be excellent with a little improvement. Overall it does look and feel premium. I'll make one more suggestion while i'm at it. Why can't you make the solid back part completely rigid? Without a phone installed there is quite a bit of flex. Seems to me that should be possible and would protect the phone more from torsion forces instead of just drops.

Just got my new iphone 15 pro max, and needed a clean and durable case. I actually ordered two other cases, but they didnt work for me at all. This one, so far, is exactly what I was looking for...sturdy, easy grip on this bigger phone...and no front plastic!!! I wanted to be able to use the front screen without anything on it...much better.
"
"
I must say, I‚Äôve developed a genuine liking for this case. While, as some reviews have noted, the action button being covered is a minor quibble, it hardly diminishes my admiration for this remarkable case. Its stunning appearance, pleasing tactile feel, and my confidence in its protective capabilities make it a standout choice. I‚Äôm genuinely excited about the prospect of safeguarding my phone in style.

I‚Äôve dropped my phone too many times and this case is awesome.  It‚Äôs not too thick, but it would not work with my wireless charger.  I had to get the one that had the magnet that holds the case.  No big deal, just something I wasn‚Äôt planning on.The belt clip sucks.  I only use it when wearing shorts and throwing my phone in my pocket looks weird.  It doesn‚Äôt feel secure, the belt clip itself flops around too much.  I‚Äôm waiting for it to break. It may not, but it doesn‚Äôt feel solid, like the case does.  It seems as a secondary thought, but the case is great.

¬†** update ** after receiving my phone and trying it with the case, I decided to send it back. It seems protected, but it's very slippery! I need something with more grip.I pre-ordered the iPhone 15 pro max and wanted to have a case for when my phone arrives. I chose this one and one other and this pelican case seems well built, sturdy and durable. Much more so than the other case I bought. I wouldn't exactly call the sides grippy, but they are textured and I think they will help prevent drops. I plan to keep this pelican case and send back the other. I will update my review once I have the phone and I'm able to really test it.

Don‚Äôt think that you can buy a large phone, a strong case, and not feel like it ends up big in the hand. If you understand that one-handed use isn‚Äôt the best way to use this phone, you‚Äôll have zero issues with this case.I also grew to like that the back of the case is recessed behind the edges. I found my finger would sit on the edge of the camera bump rather than falling into the camera bump and smudging the lenses. While I was concerned about not having a dedicated button for the action button rather than the open slot, it‚Äôs really well thought out. The edge of the case gives away to an opening that your finger rests very nicely into, and provides easy access to pressing/holding the action button.All in all, very nice case.

I absolutely loved the way the case looked and felt. It also provides a ton of protection. However, the lip all the way around the back is a problem with Magsafe in landscape orientation. If you always use Magsafe in portrait mode, this should be fine. It is also fine if you have round Magsafe mounts and chargers, but several of my chargers, like my extra battery/stand and the mount in my car, are rectangular, and I occasionally like to use both in landscape mode. If you attempt that in these circumstances, the magnet may hold, but it won't make solid contact or charge.On the plus side, the lip around the back makes the camera protection look less obtrusive. The camera bump on the iPhone 15 Pro Max is surprisingly deep. Cases that simply have a lip protrusion to protect the camera module are awkward because they have to be so deep. On two sides, the lip for the camera module only has to make up the difference between the lip around the entire back and the depth it needs to be to protect the camera module. This feels and looks better. I bought and tried 5 cases and on three of them the camera module protection protruded so far that I returned them not so on this one. I returned this one because of the landscape Magsafe issue I discuss above.

I work in the HVAC industry and was looking for a case that was reasonably priced but protective for my new phone everyday out in the field. This case fit the bill perfectly. It has a nice grip to it (a slightly raised edge around the perimeter of the rear of the phone is nice for griping).The appearance is sleek, the quality is what you would expect from Pelican, and the charging accessibility is unhindered.This is an all a round great case that has been battle tested out in the field.

The only brand of phone case my bf likes! Slim and protective for phone

06/2023 UPDATE:I wanted to update my review after my case fell apart and I had to submit a warranty claim. The claim process was relatively easy, submitted a claim form, received an email, sent pictures in of the case now falling apart. Pretty much all the potential problems I listed in my initial review came true. The buttons on the sides started to come free, the hinged power port broke off, and the magnetic bits in the back had lost their adhesion and become free. The response I received was that the case was out of stock and I could pick an alternate case or wait for it to be restocked. None of the cases available were anywhere near the price point or protection of this case so I declined. I received notification today that the case was back in stock. Great! Well not so fast. Before they will ship I HAVE TO PAY $7.49usd FOR SHIPPING OF THE REPLACEMENT CASE. This is definitely poor customer service. This will be my LAST CaseMate brand purchase. And you will find the replacement on ebay at discounted rate as ive already switched to a Otterbox. My advice again is to not buy this case and get an Otterbox instead.Original Review:So this is my second pelican case and it seems they still haven't fixed the short comings from the first one I purchased for my iPhone 11 Pro Max which I finally replaced with a Otterbox Defender.Pro's: Sturdy case, very protective, allows use of screen and camera lens protectors. Two piece design, securely holds phone. Best drop rating I could find. Stylish Kevlar weave finish.Con's: Id say the BIGGEST one for me is the little ""door"" that covers the Ring/Silent toggle. Unless you have TINY fingers you aren't gonna be able to easily and quickly turn it on and off. Would have been MUCH better if they had put a toggle on the side of the case to actuate the phone. I use this feature alot, so not being able to easily switch is a big issue. The second annoyance is the lightning port cover, its hard plastic it only opens .90 degrees. If you try to open it more it will snap off. This is what happened on my first case. Pelican should have just put a rubber plug there like Otterbox does. Because this cover is hard plastic and only opens 90 degrees when I try to charge it in my dash cradle, it does not sit fully in the cradle. The only solution is to not bother charging it, get a new cradle, get a new phone case. I had high hopes for this case, but unfortunately Pelican let me down...again. My advice get an Otterbox instead. I will probably end up getting another Otterbox Defender in the future.

Fit well. I like the lens cover accessory

I am very tough on phones and so are my kids.  $1000 phones and kids are a bad mix but with this case I've been able to navigate 3 generations of new phones across 4 kids and myself (wife is more careful than us apparently!!!).Lots of incidents over the years with no damage but the last one that is making me purchase another phone case today happened like this.  Mind you .... I am just buying a case and not a phone.Put brakes on car and had the phone on the rear deck of the car as I went to test the brakes out.  40 miles an hour (est.) the phone fly's off the car into the street.  By the time I got home, my wife is freaking out and getting in the car because she just got a notice from Apple that I was in an accident via the accident notification technology in the new software (the whole family gets the message btw).  I explained I was ok and asked why she thought I was in an  accident.  She showed me the message from Apple and asked where my phone was....uh...bye bye.Retraced steps, part of the case is on the road and as I approached I could see the other half 20km away on the road but no phone.  As I was walking to pick up the pieces, I see the phone on the sidewalk face up and working.Net result...one small crack on the back corner and a little road rash on a corner.  That's it.  Phone works perfectly.  All the buttons and hinged pieces on the case are gone and a couple of pieces missing on the corners....but I'm still using it until the new one gets here.My case of choice for those times when only the best protection is needed.

I was not impressed upon first opening the product, there is no rubber membrane incorporated into this case. With that being said it‚Äôs sturdy and solid. Figment is perfect and it‚Äôs near seamless with my spigen glass screen protector. The side latches clip soundly and the feel of the buttons are perfect! I didn‚Äôt like the charging port at first but it‚Äôs grown on me. What really sold me is the styling of the back plate. There is a flaw to be pointed out: the front screen has good depth within the case. While the rear facing cameras have VERY shallow depth! The bezel is hardly raised past the camera lenses. My concern is that when a lens protector is installed on the camera lenses the protector will likely make contact with what ever surface you place the back of the phone on! Another flaw is that the case is smooth, meaning it has no grip, no rubber, not even indents or markings to help grip the sides. This is not beneficial for grip but does allow the phone to enter and leave your pocket without difficulty. I‚Äôm pleased with the product thus far, although I have yet to drop it. You can find videos on YouTube of the pelican shield being dropped 20ft in tests on iPhone 12 (phone survived without noticeable damage). I would take this case over the otter box, lifeproof, griffin, ghostek, catalyst, urban armor, and any other mediocre case. More protection at a better price point and a lifetime warranty.

I like the look of it. It fits perfectly, and, as far as I can tell, it protects my phone as well as any other case. I‚Äôm not going to drop my phone and find out. There is one aspect of this clear case, which isn‚Äôt exactly a problem, it‚Äôs just something that I never thought of. I use the flashlight on my phone, several times a day, and the clear case throws light back in my eyes. It‚Äôs a little bit annoying, but more importantly, it reduces my ability to see at night. If the description of this product had said, by the way, this clear case is going to throw a light back in your eyes when you use the flashlight at night , I would not have purchased it. I wouldn‚Äôt say the cases defective. As far as I know, all clear cases have this issue. I wouldn‚Äôt buy a clear case in the future.

Recently bought a new phone and went from iPhone 11 to iPhone 14 Pro Max. I was so impressed with the first one of these cases I had that I knew I had to purchase the same one for my new phone.Maybe it‚Äôs because the phone is larger but the case doesn‚Äôt feel as rugged as the first one I had. I looked them both over and they are almost identical in every aspect of material thickness and functionality. But it still seems off. I did notice that the belt clip does not have the rigidity of my original. And it also doesn‚Äôt snap back into a stand position like the original one.The open/close latches to put the case on have changed slightly from my first case but I‚Äôm not as impressed with them. I didn‚Äôt get that heavy snap when I put the case together.I‚Äôm not one that severely abuses their phone so I am sure that this case will do the trick but there are some subtle differences that I‚Äôm not completely sold on yet.Overall fit is 100% accurate without any areas being blocked or over exposed.

Muy buen case, me encanta pero el clip se rompi√≥ r√°pido no es muy resistente. que recomendaci√≥n m dan?
"
"
The charging port cover is the best part of the whole phone case! Don‚Äôt get me wrong it is probably one of the best phone cases you can get if you want maximum protection. I have used this exact model for years on other iPhones but I was really hesitant to buy it again because I had to warranty the older models because of the plastic cover. Instead this one has a hinged plastic cover that will not break off. It needs to be in the product description.
"

Good protection without hiding your phone color.
"

I have used Pelican cases for a long time, and they are  great. They are high-quality cases made to be durable and last a long time, and they are made in the USA.Unfortunately, I assumed this phone case would also be made in the US. Nope. Made in China. Companies like Pelican need to stop funding the world‚Äôs biggest threat while charging ridiculous prices on the products they had made for them with cheap labor and materials.
"
"
I own a 2022 BMW M440i competition vehicle. The vehicle comes equipped with a wireless charger, but the case does not allow my phone to charge wirelessly in the vehicle. I must take the case off in order for it to charge. Other than this problem, it‚Äôs a great case and peak for protection.
"
"
Dropped my iPhone 14 pro max one time with this case on it  and screen cracked on the first drop.. of course I wasn‚Äôt expecting to drop it.. but the case did nothing to protect it.. accidents happen I guess. But it your buying a case to protect your phone this is not for you. Id go with a better case then this I guess
"
"
Still uses this case it‚Äôs very durable and protective
"
"
After reading the bad reviews I considered not buying them but I‚Äôve used Pelican gear for years s for my work so I went ahead and ordered them. These are some of the best cases I have ever had for an iPhone and I‚Äôve been using iPhones since 2009. They are perfect:. Trust me, ignore the bad reviews. You can thank me later. You won‚Äôt regret choosing this case.
"
"
Since it has no rubber material on it at all, that smooth plastic makes the phone very hard to grip and hang on to. It would be fine for those who like to carry their phones in their pocket but since I almost dropped my phone several times from just not being able to grip it, it wasn‚Äôt going to work for me so I will be returning. Came from an Otterbox so I guess I will be going back to another one.
"
"
Great protection and not bulky
"
"
This case fits the 15 Pro Max well but is lacking considering the price. First off being a Pelican it would be nice to see a premium feature like a charge port dust cover. I‚Äôve had this case on my phone for less than a week and the back ‚Äúcarbon fiber‚Äù is already showing blemishes and scratches. Overall seems like a good case but not really worth the premium cost. I just received my Otterbox Commuter, which I have used on my previous iPhones for years. For the price I feel the Otterbox is a more robust case albeit a bit more bulky.
"
"
Easy to install, high quality case. Looks great, and functional
"
"
very good durable case but slippery...will buy otterbox next time.
"
"
I am like a child with my phones. Dropping them, getting them wet/dusty, throwing them in gym bags and handbags. Even taking them in the shower. This is the case to have! I‚Äôve dropped my new 14 pro max multiple times on concrete, tile, asphalt, down metal equipment at the gym‚Ä¶.and this case is holding up.
"
"
Muy buenos
"
"
The strength of the case is excellent and does the job.  I‚Äôve dropped this a few times and it‚Äôs always held up. The only negative is the case is slippery which makes it easy to slip and fall on the ground.
"
"
I‚Äôm really conflicted about keeping this phone case. Backed by a quality name and nice design (I‚Äôm tempted to keep).. it‚Äôs clear that this case is NOT designed for iPhone 15 pro max as they say. Big give away is the new programable action button vs the slide type in the upper left had side of the new iPhone. This case is for the 14 pro max (old slide button).. I feel deceived a bit but I can appreciate this case that comes with a lifetime warranty.
"
"
I had ordered the Dark Brown but returned for the light Brown.Thank you for the tremendously strong items
"
"
Instead of a button, they decided that a flimsy flap will suffice. Same flap covering the charging port. Both require you to have fingernails to dig into in order to open. Too bad‚Ä¶returning immediately.
"
"
The case is very ""pro-magneticy"" and every mag-pro thing I've stuck to it works great. The only down side is that it's a little slippery. I wish the plastic had a better grip, or ridged or something. But, it does work, due to the slickness of the finish, I've dropped it a few times and I've had no cracks, so that's good! But, add a different finish or ridges or something please.
"
"
Muy resistente y lindo
"
"
I have broken too many iPhones in my life so I needed something tough. I‚Äôm cartoonishly clumsy. I‚Äôve already *violently* dropped my phone out of my car on the concrete twice already and not even a scratch. The MagSafe thingy is also a game changer. 10/10
"
"
I‚Äôve always been a otter box user but had wanted to switch it up and try something else. Being a carpenter and on job sites daily I need the extra protection. The first one I bought I received promptly, and quickly began installation. Post installation I‚Äôd realized that one of the small rubber inserts that allows you to control turning the phone screen off when not in use was missing. After half a day I quickly realized that without this button the case was useless so I emailed pelican inquiring on how to go about getting a replacement. After 2 days of no response I ended up ordering another case just so I could use it for it‚Äôs intended purpose. I never got any kind of response from pelican. Yesterday I went to change my screen protector and low and behold that same little rubber piece must have come out of the case and is nowhere to be found. So here I am with two months worth of use, 2 useless (expensive) cases and ordering a otter box. I honestly liked the case but this design flaw makes this case just about useless.
"

This is the second pelican case I‚Äôve owned, last one was for an iPhone 11 max. My previous case held up for several years under some pretty profound beatings and I was pleased so after reading the reviews to these ones, my only concern was getting the right case the first go around. I did get the right case, which was great, but find myself disappointed in my perception of the build quality/design. For starters, pelican used to use hard rubber close points for the silence and charging openings. They were durable, yet malleable enough to actually finagle them open enough to access both. The hard cased plastic on this model makes it extremely difficult to silence, and even a challenge to plug in to charge. The rubber on the old models subtly served as a better grip surface in my opinion, allowing you to get a better hold of the device, especially when navigating with a single hand. The plastic on these, seems slippery and while although secure, doesn‚Äôt even appear uniform where the case meshes together at several points. I know the faces at those points are raised slightly for finger nail access to open by design, but they aren‚Äôt really necessary. They make the case seem poorly finished. The exterior finish on the back is a mirror image of the old one, which I am pleased with and lasted me the three years I owned my other phone, same look, finish and material. Looks nice to say the least and like I said before, is durable from experience. I guess time will tell if I adjust, but honestly if my old case fit, I would be going back to using it on this phone. The otter box I have on my work phone, provides much more grip and the same rubber components these cases used to have, which are the primary features changed between eras. Otherwise, product arrived timely, was the right case, and fits as advertised. Would certainly be better if they had some of its old components brought back.
"
"
It‚Äôs clear that this case was made with high quality, heavy duty materials that will keep my new iPhone 15 Pro Max safe from drops. The durability of Pelican products is unmatched and this case is exactly what I would expect from such a reputable brand.

Brand name Pelican Case Cut Corners making this case in a Rush, in order to compete.Appearance looks and feels comfortable. But however, the Action Button is covered by a ‚Äúflap‚Äù. In order to press and hold on Action Button, becoming a two step process, one must uncover the Flap, reach into the access hole push the button. If you got a large finger, Good Luck reaching into the Action Button!Built in magnet, or aka MagSafe is laughable!Strength comes right off my Apple MagSafe vehicle charger as I slowly traverse over a low speed bump. Plump, it fell right off!Overall, Protection looks not bad. Easy to pop in and take out!Forgot to mention, USB-C access port is also Laughable! Only cabled made standard size will fit! Anything greater in width will be stuck, before it ever reaches into the port. You will never feel that click..Overall, recommendation is up to you to Explore!Two out of Five Stars for my collection..

I have had the case about a month. The case is holding up ok but the belt clip broke. The belt clip also doesn‚Äôt hold the phone in place at the corners and phone will fall out. Case has passed the drop test on several occasions. I would have thought that a Pelican case would have had a belt clip that would hold up. I had an Otter Box for two years and it held up. The clip for the belt is thin and flimsy. This is something I would expect from a 20 dollar case and not a 60 dollar case. Time to see if they stand behind their warranty.
"
"
It‚Äôs very strong and does it‚Äôs job well- my only complaint is that it is very slippery and it‚Äôs very hard to flip the silent switch on and off- I prefer Otterboxes grip but Pelicans case is this way so you can use a mag charger so it‚Äôs a compromise-I rated 4 stars because it is to slippery for me but some may like better‚Äî all in all it‚Äôs a fantastic case and is money well spent..
"
"
I normally use an Otterbox defender but wanted to try something a little more minimalist this time around. It could have a better grip but otherwise it seems adequate and it is definitely less bulky.
"
"
The case looks great and easy to install on the iPhone 15 pro max. Great protection for the iPhone.
"
"
This is a wonderful case. I‚Äôve used pelican brand products on devices in the past and have to be disappointed. That being said, the only reason it‚Äôs getting 4 stars instead of 5, is that I was sent the wrong one. While this may have been a clerical issue, it shouldn‚Äôt have been an issue to begin with.However, once I got in contact with customer service, they sent me the right one in the mail and the case works perfectly.If you want to take the chance of maybe getting the right case, go ahead and order from here. Otherwise, you‚Äôd be better off ordering from the source. It‚Äôs still the same price.All that being said, again I‚Äôm happy with the case. It‚Äôs better than what I first had and will do until I find something more appealing.
"
"
Always make the best protection case. I had one for 14 pro max. So I decided to buy one for 15 pro max. I‚Äôm happy I did.
"
"
I love it  easy to put on and durable without being too bulky
"
"
I've had this case for a month now and it has performed very well.  It is designed and manufactured well and what I would expect from a brand like Pelican.  The raised ridge around the screen provides good protection of the most sensitive area, the back has raised ridges around the camera lenses.  Overall very happy with the case.  I'm rough on phones and this sure looks like its going to hold up for me.  This is a bit bulky, but necessary to provide the protection it does.
"
"
Had it for a couple months and is perfect still.
"
"
Works and fit perfect without any problems on my 15 pro max.
"
"
Very durable but can‚Äôt access the switch to go between silent and ring
"
"
Always love pelican cases. Works great covers phone. Not bulky. Only thing annoying is charger port flap doesn‚Äôt stay closed
"
"
At first, this case seemed pretty nice and durable. but after using it on the new iPhone 15 Pro Max, it is becoming more apparent that they cut corners on this case. its only been a few days, and one of the rubber buttons has already ripped and is falling out because the rubber is so thin. and its super inconvenient to use the new action button since this case has a rubber flap covering it and not a molded button like the others.  I'm ordering a better quality case before more of the rubber rips and will be sending this one back sadly
"
"
Nice case
"
"
So far so good. It‚Äôs done it‚Äôs job protecting my phone from myself and the toddler dropping it regularly.
"
"
I‚Äôve waited a little while before writing this review. I honestly didn‚Äôt know how this case was going to hold up. I drop my phones constantly. I‚Äôm a total clutz and butterfingers. I‚Äôve dropped this phone so many times everyone knows the sound of it hitting the floor. But this case has held up great! I love the clear material it‚Äôs made of and the MagSafe chargeable case works perfectly. It strongly holds the magnetic charger in place and I haven‚Äôt had a single issue charging my phone. I am so happy to finally not worry about worn out charging cables or wearing out the charging port on my phone. It doesn‚Äôt come with a screen protector. I bought that separately and I bought a package of screen protectors that also came with camera protectors as well. The camera protector I bought separately is the only thing I‚Äôve had to replace due to drops and that‚Äôs likely because the bumper around the camera isn‚Äôt that thick. Also the case is nearly flush with the phone but that hasn‚Äôt been an issue with the drops. I would recommend a good screen protector just in case if you‚Äôre rough on phones like me. All in all I really like this case and would recommend it. Thank you pelican

¬†While I‚Äôve always found the Pelican brand to be top tier. This phone case is garbage and the advertising is false. Dropped my phone this morning it bounced off the side of my foot before landing on on carpet and now this expensive ‚Äú21 foot drop guarantee‚Äù case is useless because the corner is missing.
"

They did send me the correct case for my iphone 14 Pro MAX.  The box does say ""Pro"" on it but it does fit my Max fine.  I also have a lens protector over my camera and this case works with a lens protector from another band attached to the camera.  I wish the lip was a little higher around the glass like they had on their iphone X Case but it is still better than their Ranger case (which i ordered and tried by mistake).  To be honest, I can't find a case with a real high bevel around the glass like how they use to make these cases.You can also use this case with a glass screen protector over your phone's touch screen.  Mine case fit fine.Very secure, Pelican is a great brand, best I think is out there with how they are making these cases nowadays.  See attached pics for camera fit and screen bevel around the glass.

I have been using Pelican for all my iPhones and iPads! I love the quality and the sturdiness. My iPhones have fell thousand times on wood, cement etc and never ever has been damaged!

Love the raise edges and that it‚Äôs 15‚Äôdrop approved.

I‚Äôve never had a case mess with my reception before. And I‚Äôve had this brand and style for all my iPhones but it‚Äôs unusable outside the house as it blocks my reception. So so disappointing. And ‚Äúanti yellowing‚Äù is a joke. Started to yellow in two days. Maybe someday we‚Äôll have the technology to have clear cases not turn yellow. But apparently 2023 is not that year.

It does a very good job protecting my phone, but it is very slippery. I think there should be some sort of grip added to it.
"
"
Great case overall but I see myself rarely using this mainly for the case having 0 grip what so ever and the mute switch is nearly impossible to get to . If the shell was made of a rubberized material instead of the plastic material it would‚Äôve been no near a 5 star.
"
"
It protects the phone really well and I‚Äôve dropped it about 3 times on concrete and asphalt and the phone and case don‚Äôt have any scratches or cracked and it‚Äôs sleek and low profile makes it fit in my pocket very nicely
"
"
Not at all happy about the brand name permanently printed on the face of the case. Every where I go, I will be known as Mr. Pelican.Anyway, this is intended to be a temporary case while I wait for the preferred case to be in stock again. I needed to use something quickly, as I‚Äôd rather not be without a case.

A well manufactured case which provides good protection for your phone, the optional clip to hold the phone of a belt is good if you need to have ready access to your phone while being mobile.
"
"
Normally, Pelican is my go-to for phone cases. Better protection than an otter box and is less expensive but this version will not fit the phone it is advertised to fit. Sadly I'm disappointed.Follow up- case mate contacted me and figured out what happened. They made it right by sending me the correct case for my phone so I have to give the company props and a much better rating. Thanks for making things right

For the price you pay you think all components of this case is legit especially with there name .Phone case is not bad , phone clip is just not it barely clips on to your clothes ,very easy to fall off . Phone barley clips on easy to the clip as well ..

This is the second case line this that ive bought. the first one was for a 12 pro max, and now for the 14 pro max. they are awesome and hold up for years of abuse.
"
"
This case could uses some type of grip along the edges. The I-phone 14 Pro Max is a wide phone and I was always afraid of it slipping out of my hands with this case. I didn't like the flap that goes over the mute switch above the volume keys. The entire case, sides and back, feels like a cheap material as well. Way over priced for what you get in my opinion. I bit the bullet on this one and ended up buying a more expensive case but from another company. I won't name the company because I don't want people to think this is an add for them. It's not. I'm just going to say it's always been a popular company and for good reason. I personally do not recommend this case to anyone unless you absolutely have to buy it.

Es resistente

Not a otter box but for the price is a good buy and it‚Äôs pretty durable
"
"
A little heavy but pr
"

I switched my Otterbox defender series for this case and now I‚Äôm about to switch back. There is only hard plastic and hard rubber all over the case so it‚Äôs very slippery I‚Äôm your hands the buttons feel cheap and feels like they want to come off at anytime possible. Magnet doesn‚Äôt feel any different if anything it‚Äôs weaker. And the way to unlock the case is just cheap you have 3 flaps that you need to open and they all have this cheap feel it‚Äôs not a good case especially for the price I will definitely try to return this because $60 for this cheap plastic case is ridiculous
"
"
I'm not sure if some of the other reviewers are getting the correct case sent to them, or perhaps they're not putting the case on properly.  My case fits perfectly on my iPhone 14 Pro Max, protecting the lenses on the back and fitting like a glove.  And it feels great, nice texture and size.If I had any complaint about fit it would be that the volume up button is hard to push through the case (sthe volume down and power buttons are fine).  It's also $10 cheaper now than when I bought it 3 weeks ago, annoying.  But that's about it...liking the case.

The case itself is great. But the waist clip broke after only a few days using it.
"
"
I love this case because it provides so much protection for your iPhone and it‚Äôs great quality!

Pelican makes great cases for many purposes and I‚Äôve always been pleased and impressed by their durability, not so with my iPhone 14 case. I need a rugged and protective phone case because I do occasionally drop my phone.  Although my phone was never damaged the iPhone case kinda fell apart.Soon after I started using the case the right button fell out and disappeared while changing the glass protector.  This button seems to have been placed in the plastic door/latch without a means to secure it.I dropped the phone with case onto the floor and a corner of the case broke. Later the front part/bezel broke while removing the phone from the case which was necessary to operate the right button.Overall I have no choice but to be totally disappointed in the quality of this Pelican product.

Looks great, not too bulky, I‚Äôve dropped my phone way too much with it on and it takes the hits like a champ. Would recommend it.
"
"
Great case, other than it was clearly not designed for the new Action Button.  Instead it still has a flap to uncover the old flip-style mute switch.  Huge disappointment.
"
"
It‚Äôs very nice looking. Feels like quality plastic. I like it a lot. Not much else to say.
"
"
I absolutely hate this phone case.  I am not sure what the designer was thinking when they left the edge of the case flush with the screen.  This means any time toy are holding the phone that is no from the back your skin will be in contact with the touch screen.  If you buy this case get ready for thousands of mis hits in any program you use.  This occurs in games, videos, using the camera, reading apps, you name it.  The depth on the back edge would have prevented this type of problem if it had been placed on the front edge.  Unless you plan to set your phone down and never hold it aside from powering your phone off or on I would advise against the purchase of this case.
"
"
It‚Äôs a good case like most pelican cases but it‚Äôs made for the 14 Plus and not the Pro Max because the camera slot is too small.
"
"
I have been using Pelican cases for at least 10+ years. Never had a problem with warranty. Customer service has always responded quickly and these cases are the best. Never have had a damaged phone
"
"
Case works well.  Only drawback is that the front edge seems to easily get dinged up.  May not last very long
"
"
I have dropped this phone several times because there is no grips and the sides are smooth. I went with another case.
"
"
Great item my dad really loves it a lot.
"
"
I think this case has potential. However, the rubber button for the left side Siri button comes out very easily. It‚Äôs not connected to the case at all. So when you take the case off the phone, the button easily comes out and gets lost. So to access the Siri button, you have to remove the phone from the case. What‚Äôs the point? That is why I gave it 2 stars. Good case overall, but that is deal killer for me. Too expensive of a case for such a simple, but obvious flaw. Avoid this case unless Pelican fixes the problem.
"
"
Great product only need to fix something to keep on side the bottoms because if you take off and not see can lose.
"
"
This is a great case very well with the money
"
"
These are the best phone protection on the market.
"
"
Holster is too open and doesn‚Äôt protect the screen from anything touching it unintentionally. The iPhone 8 Plus case was thicker. Feels slippery so difficult to grip.
"
"
I do machanic work and have dropped this thing in engine bays all kinda stuff even forgot about it by the exhaust system and ran the car abt the best case ever bought
